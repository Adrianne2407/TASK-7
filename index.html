                    <h3>My Childhood</h3>
                    <p>When I was a child, I was a happy child with plenty of friends and dreams galore. I used to dream of being a seaman because I was amazed by seamen and even more so when I discovered that they could travel to many nations and the entire world.</p>

                    <h3>My Teenage Life</h3>
                    <p>When I was in my teenage years, I became shy, I had insecurities, and I had a girlfriend too, but we just texted; we didn't really meet in person &#128517; I had crushes in school before, and I knew someone liked me too; my education was not going well because of a lack of financial resources because we were poor; sometimes we couldn't afford to pay for the tuition, but by God's grace, we still got through it. &#x1F607;</p>

                    <h3>My Aduthood</h3>
                    <p>As I enter adulthood, I can say that this is really real life. There are problems that you never expected to experience in real life, especially when my girlfriend and I had a child. There were so many problems that came into our lives that I can't mention them one by one, but God didn't abandon us. We keep fighting the hardships of life. I got a job on the ship. We got married. We continued to dream and live a simple but happy life with our two children.</p>
